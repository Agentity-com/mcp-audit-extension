# Contributing to our project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're excited to build a community around this project.

As we are in the early stages of development, we are currently focused on establishing the core architecture and roadmap. To ensure we can build a cohesive foundation, we are still in the process of setting up our workflow for community contributions.

For this reason, **we are not accepting pull requests at this time.**

The most valuable way you can help us right now is by providing feedback. Please feel free to:
* Report bugs by **opening an issue**.
* Suggest enhancements or new features to support@agentity.com.

We are working hard to formalize our contribution model and will update this guide as soon as we are ready to welcome code contributions. Thank you for your support!
